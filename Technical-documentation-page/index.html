                <h2>Overview</h2>
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and
                methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — many structures from those languages apply to
                JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes, instead of
                classes (see more about prototypical inheritance and ES2015 classes). JavaScript also supports
                functional programming — because they are objects, functions may be stored in variables and passed
                around like any other object.</p>
            <p>Let's start off by looking at the building blocks of any language: the types. JavaScript programs
                manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type. JavaScript's types are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Function</li>
                <li>Object</li>
                <li>Symbol (new in ES2015)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>... oh, and undefined and null, which are ... slightly odd. And Array, which is a special kind of object.
                And Date and RegExp, which are objects that you get for free. And to be technically accurate, functions
                are just a special type of object. So the type diagram looks more like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Symbol (new in ES2015)</li>
                <li>Object</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Function</li>
                    <li>Array</li>
                    <li>Date</li>
                    <li>RegExp</li>
                </ul>
                <li>null</li>
                <li>undefined</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And there are some built-in Error types as well. Things are a lot easier if we stick with the first
                diagram, however, so we'll discuss the types listed there for now.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Numbers">
            <header>
                <h2>Numbers</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Numbers in JavaScript are "double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values", according to the spec —
                There's no such thing as an integer in JavaScript (except BigInt), so you have to be a little careful.
                See this example:</p>
            <code>console.log(3 / 2);             // 1.5, not 1 
console.log(Math.floor(3 / 2)); // 1</code>
            <p>So an apparent integer is in fact implicitly a float.</p>
            <p>Also, watch out for stuff like:</p>
            <code>0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30000000000000004;</code>
            <p>In practice, integer values are treated as 32-bit ints, and some implementations even store it that way
                until they are asked to perform an instruction that's valid on a Number but not on a 32-bit integer.
                This can be important for bit-wise operations.</p>
            <p>The standard arithmetic operators are supported, including addition, subtraction, modulus (or remainder)
                arithmetic, and so forth. There's also a built-in object that we did not mention earlier called Math
                that provides advanced mathematical functions and constants:</p>
            <code>Math.sin(3.5);
var circumference = 2 * Math.PI * r;</code>
            <p>You can convert a string to an integer using the built-in parseInt() function. This takes the base for
                the conversion as an optional second argument, which you should always provide:</p>
            <code>parseInt('123', 10); // 123
parseInt('010', 10); // 10</code>
            <p>In older browsers, strings beginning with a "0" are assumed to be in octal (radix 8), but this hasn't
                been the case since 2013 or so. Unless you're certain of your string format, you can get surprising
                results on those older browsers:</p>
            <code>parseInt('010');  //  8
parseInt('0x10'); // 16</code>
            <p>Here, we see the parseInt() function treat the first string as octal due to the leading 0, and the second
                string as hexadecimal due to the leading "0x". The hexadecimal notation is still in place; only octal
                has been removed.</p>
            <p>If you want to convert a binary number to an integer, just change the base:</p>
            <code>parseInt('11', 2); // 3</code>
            <p>Similarly, you can parse floating point numbers using the built-in parseFloat() function. Unlike its
                parseInt() cousin, parseFloat() always uses base 10.</p>
            <p>You can also use the unary + operator to convert values to numbers:</p>
            <code>+ '42';   // 42
+ '010';  // 10
+ '0x10'; // 16</code>
            <p>A special value called NaN (short for "Not a Number") is returned if the string is non-numeric:</p>
            <code>parseInt('hello', 10); // NaN</code>
            <p>NaN is toxic: if you provide it as an operand to any mathematical operation, the result will also be NaN:
            </p>
            <code>NaN + 5; // NaN</code>
            <p>You can test for NaN using the built-in isNaN() function:</p>
            <code>isNaN(NaN); // true</code>
            <p>JavaScript also has the special values Infinity and -Infinity:</p>
            <code> 1 / 0; //  Infinity
-1 / 0; // -Infinity</code>
            <p>You can test for Infinity, -Infinity and NaN values using the built-in isFinite() function</p>
            <code>isFinite(1 / 0); // false
isFinite(-Infinity); // false
isFinite(NaN); // false</code>

                <h2>Strings</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Strings in JavaScript are sequences of Unicode characters. This should be welcome news to anyone who has
                had to deal with internationalization. More accurately, they are sequences of UTF-16 code units; each
                code unit is represented by a 16-bit number. Each Unicode character is represented by either 1 or 2 code
                units.</p>
            <p>If you want to represent a single character, you just use a string consisting of that single character.
            </p>
            <p>To find the length of a string (in code units), access its length property:</p>
            <code>'hello'.length; // 5</code>
            <p>There's our first brush with JavaScript objects! Did we mention that you can use strings like objects
                too? They have methods as well that allow you to manipulate the string and access information about the
                string:</p>
            <code>'hello'.charAt(0); // "h"
'hello, world'.replace('world', 'mars'); // "hello, mars"
'hello'.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO"</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Other_types">
            <header>
                <h2>Other types</h2>
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript distinguishes between null, which is a value that indicates a deliberate non-value (and is
                only accessible through the null keyword), and undefined, which is a value of type undefined that
                indicates an uninitialized variable — that is, a value hasn't even been assigned yet. We'll talk about
                variables later, but in JavaScript it is possible to declare a variable without assigning a value to it.
                If you do this, the variable's type is undefined. undefined is actually a constant.</p>
            <p>JavaScript has a boolean type, with possible values true and false (both of which are keywords.) Any
                value can be converted to a boolean according to the following rules:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>false, 0, empty strings (""), NaN, null, and undefined all become false.</li>
                <li>All other values become true.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can perform this conversion explicitly using the Boolean() function:</p>
            <code>Boolean('');  // false
Boolean(234); // true</code>
            <p>However, this is rarely necessary, as JavaScript will silently perform this conversion when it expects a
                boolean, such as in an if statement (see below). For this reason, we sometimes speak simply of "true
                values" and "false values," meaning values that become true and false, respectively, when converted to
                booleans. Alternatively, such values can be called "truthy" and "falsy", respectively.</p>
            <p>Boolean operations such as && (logical and), || (logical or), and ! (logical not) are supported; see
                below.</p>
